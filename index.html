  <h1>Debbi's "Are You Trapped or Free" Quiz</h1>
  <p class="intro">
    Are you moving through life freely, or do you feel stuck in a place you didn't choose?<br>
    Do you wake with a sense of joy, or has that feeling quietly slipped away?<br><br>
    This self-assessment invites you to pause and reflect—on your happiness, your freedom, and the space between. There are no right answers, only a clearer picture of the path you're on.

    <h2>Quadrant Descriptions</h2>

    <h3>1. The Resigned</h3>
    <p><strong>Trapped and Unhappy</strong><br>
    You may feel stuck in your current circumstances and deeply dissatisfied. You might be in a job, relationship, or life situation that doesn't fulfil you, and yet it seems difficult or impossible to leave. Fear, obligation, or a lack of resources may be holding you in place. This quadrant often carries a sense of burnout, apathy, or quiet resignation.</p>

    <h3>2. The Restless</h3>
    <p><strong>Untrapped and Unhappy</strong><br>
    You are free to make changes in your life — and you know it — but you still struggle to find contentment. You may move from job to job, place to place, or person to person, hoping for something more. Though you have options, you may feel unanchored or uncertain of what will truly bring you joy.</p>

    <h3>3. The Settled</h3>
    <p><strong>Trapped and Happy</strong><br>
    You may have made commitments or taken on responsibilities that limit your freedom, but you've found peace in them. You've chosen stability, duty, or routine — and they give your life meaning. You might not have boundless freedom, but you've created a fulfilling life within the structure you've chosen.</p>

    <h3>4. The Free and Fulfilled</h3>
    <p><strong>Untrapped and Happy</strong><br>
    You enjoy both emotional well-being and the freedom to choose your path. You live in alignment with your values, often making deliberate decisions to keep your life flexible and meaningful. You have clarity, peace, and the sense that you're exactly where you're meant to be.</p>
